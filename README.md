Customer Fraud Detection Analysis using Machine learning models



The main objective of the customer Fraud detection analysis is to predict that if fraudulent credit card transactions can take place.




The steps involved in the project are:



1. exploring the dataset also visualizing the data set.



2. Data preprocessing



3. building machine learning models



4. evaluating the models



5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy



6.final model creation and analysis outcome.



for better accuracy results Isolation Forest algorithm is used



Isolation Forest is easy to implement. The algorithm is based on the fact that anomalies are data points that are few and different.As a result of these properties, anomalies are susceptible to a mechanism called isolation.







Final result of analysis:

The accuracy obtained is 99 (Isolation Forest algorithm)
